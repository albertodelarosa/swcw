The automatic machines at regular car washes are abrasive and can leave scratches in your vehicle’s paint and enamel. Even worse, they can tear off plastic siding and even damage your brakes. In Siteler Wash’s hand cleaning processes we use ultra soft wash mitts and specially designed towels which have 200,000 strands of loop-woven polyester/polyamide fiber in every square inch. These are the safest possible products that help protect your vehicle as we clean."

To begin, a regular garden hose uses about 10 times more water than our specially designed pressure washers. Further, runoff from washing your car at home goes directly into the storm drains which bypass water treatment plants. That’s very bad for the environment (you can read more from the EPA about that here). At Siteler Wash, we wash your vehicles with 100% non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally-friendly products. Hence, we not only ensure that dirt and grease are deeply dissolved and removed from your vehicle, but also ensure that the rinse from your vehicle is safe for the environment."
