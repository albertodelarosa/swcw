To begin, a regular garden hose uses about 10 times more water than our specially designed pressure washers. Further, runoff from washing your car at home goes directly into the storm drains which bypass water treatment plants. That’s very bad for the environment (you can read more from the EPA about that here). At Siteler Wash, we wash your vehicles with 100% non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally-friendly products. Hence, we not only ensure that dirt and grease are deeply dissolved and removed from your vehicle, but also ensure that the rinse from your vehicle is safe for the environment."
